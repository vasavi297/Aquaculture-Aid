  <div class="solution hidden">
    <p>
      Aquaculture Aid provides a list of government schemes on the 
      <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources page</a>. 
      Many fishers miss out on financial support, insurance, and training due to limited information. 
      Awareness campaigns, including community workshops, informational pamphlets, mobile apps, and helplines, help bridge this gap. 
      Schemes like Fishermen Welfare Programs provide pension plans, accident and life insurance, equipment subsidies, and financial aid during lean periods. 
      By engaging with these resources, fishers can improve income, access modern equipment, receive disaster assistance, and gain financial security and peace of mind.
